                    <p>Ujjwal Chaurasia named his YouTube channel as Techno Gamerz because his plan was to publish tech and gaming videos on it. Initially, he wanted to publish the unboxing videos of gadgets but later, he realised that he is way more interested
                        in gaming rather than in unboxing or technology, so he published only gaming videos on Techno Gamerz. Initially, Ujjwal Chaurasia didn’t have sufficient knowledge of shooting videos. He even didn’t know about screen recording as
                        he used to operate a phone and record its screen with another phone.</p>
